Steps:

1. Create all posible combinations for specific Lotto

2. Create file with already draw numbers for that specific lotto, this file will be used to train Neural Network

3. Compare two files created above and create 3rd file wich will contain only number that was not draw yet for lotto, this file will be used with trained Neural Network

4. Choose activation and backpropagation functions/methods for Neural Network

5. Build Neural Network

6. Train Neural Network

7. Feed Neural Network with file created in step N 3

8. Scrape new draw numbers of Lotto

9. Compare results from Neural Network to real life data scraped in step 8th
